A tool and [website](https://ontario-covid.com/) that graphs Ontario COVID-19 data.

## Viewing the Compiled Report
All the data gets compiled into `report.json`, which gets updated every day (unless something goes wrong).

### Raw Reports
Downloaded reports are saved every day to the `raw_reports` directory.

## Generate the Report
### Requirements

### Build Script
`$ ./run.sh`

This will download data from different sources to and compile it into `report.json`.

## Testing the Website

1. Install Jekyll and bundler gems: `$ bundle install`
2. Run local server: `$ bundle exec jekyll serve`

This will create a local webserver for you to test.
